BNF
===

A [Backus-Naur Form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_Form "BNF on WikiPedia") Tokenizer and Parser that can also generate "programs" from a BNF description of a programming language.

Given a text file of a language in BNF form, this program will read and tokenize the language, create a BNF object from the tokens, and then create "programs" (essentially, grammatically correct gibberish) from the language.
